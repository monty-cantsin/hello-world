# hello-world

<h2>hello!</h2>

over twenty years ago, i was given my grandpa's old 286x computer when he upgraded to a 486x (still held onto his 386x, which i eventually got when he upgraded again) and thus began my lifelong passion for computers! taught myself how to take it apart and put it back together, BIOS, how to navigate DOS, write batch files and even naively tried to program games in qbasic. hey, i was only eight.. so gimme a break!

was the kid who taught my teachers how to use the new computer introduced to the classroom and was dreadfully bored in the newly offered programming classes that my highschool began to offer.

though, shortly after graduation and in my first semester of college, life happened and i went on a radically different course in life. though i never stopped using computers and was always happy to help my friends with any computer problem they had, being homeless and travelling was not very conducive to programming. pretty much stopped writing code altogether for ~ten years.

after years of people asking me wtf i as doing in food service and much chiding, i decided to get back on the horse. got a lot of rust to knock off, but i can't believe i forgot how much i love to code!

excited to be back in this world. been spending pretty much all of my free time (which is A LOT) reteaching myself how to code. i just gotta say, all you kids who grew up with the internet are lucky af! you have no idea how hard it was to teach yourself without the information on internet readily at your disposal.

if you actually read this, cheers to you!

best of luck and never stop learning.
